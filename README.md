# DwarfSignal_Classifier
Dwarf Signal Image Classiﬁer Using CNN

a). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to classify dwarf signal images on railway tracks, aiming to
enhance train safety. The dataset includes 4,000 images categorized into ﬁve signal types: Stop, Uncertain,Caution, Go, and
Off. Each category represents a critical state in railway signaling.

b). The CNN model processes these images to accurately detect and classify the signals. By automating the detection of
dwarf signals, the system minimizes human error, ensures timely decision-making, and enhances overall train safety.

The sample Dataset and the training Scripts are on the Master branch.
